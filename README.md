# ImplementDelegateProtocol
ImplementDelegateProtocol

- You can think of a protocol as an *interface definition between two classes.
- The class that defines the protocol can be thought of as *delegating the work defined by the methods in the protocol to the class that implements them.
- In that way, the class can be defined to be more general, with specific actions taken by the delegate class in response to certain events or to define specific parameters.
